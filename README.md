# TO-DO LIST APP

A to-do list is an essential tool to help you manage tasks effectively, by getting all those tasks out of your head and onto your to-do list (no matter where you are or what device you use).
Organizing your tasks with a list can make everything much more manageable and make you feel grounded. Seeing a clear outline of your completed and uncompleted tasks will help you feel organized and stay mentally focused.
